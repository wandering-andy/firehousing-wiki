Bunk beds are not designed for adults and can only comfortably fit individuals up to 5â€™6.  Rental properties available in Safford and Duncan AZ, approximately 40 minutes to 1 hour one way commute.  Rentals can typically be found in the 600 to 1000/month range.  District housing is not recommended and is in serious disrepair.
