## Notes

Bayfield housing is at Vallecito Work Center and is very limited, with maybe only 2 beds? - An old bunk house at Vallecito where the WFM and Engine are out of. Maybe 2 rooms. Limited rentals in bayfield and Durango. Most are $$$. Home prices are outrageous. Good luck.  - Absolute shithole
