## Notes

7 spots for temps in the fire program between 2 houses on the compound.- While housing is "available", last time I was there the housing was literally in the animal barns at the fairgrounds. The housing is horrifying, it's a sectioned off bit of an old barn run by the 4H, who treat their tenants like crap - they dumped trash on our porch, accused us of smoking weed in the bunkhouse (no one was stupid enough to smoke *inside*) and kicked us out for 2 weeks out of the year. There's available housing on the compound, but that needs to be kept empty in case a botanist or somebody important needs to stay a night or two.
